   + Serial Terminal (optional)

### Operation
  1. Connect board to PC using USB-micro cable. 
     + The LEDs will **Cycle** upon startup: **BLUE-->GREEN-->YELLOW-->RED**.
     + Short delay: **BLUE-->GREEN-->YELLOW-->RED**.

  2. The **BLUE LED** will begin to blink, this indicates the board is attempting to join the local **ACCESS POINT**.

  3. On connecting to **Access Point** the blinking will stop, and the **LED** will become **STATIC**.
     + By **Default**, the device will attempt to use:
      + **WPA/WPA2**  
      + Network Name: **MCHP.IOT**    
      + Password: **microchip**

  4. To use custom Credentials, the board will appear on the PC enumerated as a mass storage device under the name **CURIOSITY**. 
     + Credentials can be downloaded as the file **WIFI.CFG** using the **CLICK-ME.HTM** file stored on the **CURIOSITY** device.
     
     ![URL Hosted Credentials](images/wifiCredentialsWeb.png)

  5. After becoming connected to the **ACCESS POINT**, the **GREEN LED** will begin to blink, this indicates the board is attempting to establish a web connection with cloud providing service. 
     + **GREEN LED** will stop blinking and remain **ON** when connection is established.
     + Using the in-module TCP/IP stack pre-configured with provisioned credentials; the device establishes a **MQTT** connection with the IoT Broker provider (AWS).

      ![Status Display](images/awsConnection.png)

  6. After successfully establishing MQTT connection, the **YELLOW LED** will blink. (250 mSec)
     + Indicating data exchanged between the End-Device (PIC-IoT), and BROKER (AWS). (every (1) Sec)

  7. Connect to the www.pic-iot.com/pic-iot/aws/**{thingName}** website to view publish/subscribe data. 
     + **{thingName}** is the unique identifier for the development board.
     + This page can be also be found via launching the **CLICK-ME.HTM** file on the **CURIOSITY** device.
     + This page can be also be found by scanning the QR code on the back of the development board. 

     ![Connecting](images/picawsLeverage.png)

  8. There will be (2) scrolling graphs visible.
      + (1) shows temperature sensor
      + (1) shows the light sensor value. 

     ![AwsGraphs](images/awsGraphs.png)

  9. Click on the **What's Next** button beneath the graphs to peform action(s) from the cloud.

  10. Select the **Implement a Cloud-Controlled Actuator** to demostrate cloud performed behaviors.

      ![AwsNext](images/awsNext.png)

  11. Click on the **Learn More** button to expand page interface. 
     + Scroll to the bottom of **Step 5** where a panel will read **Control Your Device**.

---

## Application Scope
The PIC-IoT development board has been created with the intention of demostrating a one source solution for evaluation of existing cloud provider solutions. 
This example end-device leverages the catalog of devices, and libraries provided through Microchip's extensive product line to showcase a basic Internet of Things product connection. Data exchange between server and in field device is implemented using on board sensors for temperature, and light value observations. Behavior actions are demonstrated through visual indication of the 'Data' LED as controlled through the Web based APIs. 

General Out-Of-Box operation is as described below:
1) Use the On-Board WINC1510 WiFi module to establish local WiFi connection to Router/Switch or Network source. 
2) The WINC1510 through use of the ECC608 Cyrpo establishes a Secure (TLS) Socket Connection with select Cloud Provider using a TCP connection. The Blue 'WiFi' LED is used to indicate this status. 
3) Using the Microchip Software Library for the Message-Queuing-Telemetry-Transport (MQTT) standard format; data is exchanged between client (end-device) and broker (cloud). The Green 'Connect' LED is used to indicate this status. 
4) Sensor Data is sent as Telemetry Data between device and broker at a near periodic rate of (1) Second. The Yellow 'Data' LED is used to indicate this status. 
5) Capture of Data sent from Broker to Device can be observed through a Serial terminal when USB-Micro is connected to development board. 
6) Behavior variation can be observed on the 'Data' LED when triggered through the web based API, and sent through the broker to end device using MQTT protocol transported through the TCP connection securely established using the ECC608 Crypto device. 
7) The Push button has no effect outside of variation of start-up operation; refer to User Guide for additional information regarding Soft-AP operation.

* The Red 'Data' LED remaining on may indicate a hardware fault issue with the development board.

## Secure Provisioning & Transport Layer Security

1. The PIC-IoT board under the Wireless for Amazon Web Services (WA) variation is shipped pre-provisioned for coordination with the AWS Cloud system.
2. Security is achieved by using the built-in Transport Layer Security (TLS) 'stack' configured within the WINC Wi-Fi Module.
3. A Pre-Manufacturing process has configured the appropriate Slot locations on the ATECC608A security device.
4. All required certificates used for signing and authentication have been written to, and 'locked' into allocated slots.
     + This process is achieved through: [TrustFlex](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform/trustflex/trustflex-aws-iot-authentication)
     + Additional options are also supported, such as: [Trust&Go](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform/trust-go)
     + Fully scope of support for Secure Aspects of development can be found here: [Trust Platform](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform)
5. This process has been performed to allow for an Out Of Box (OOB) operation of the PIC-IoT development board along with supporting web page.
6. Shadow Topic are a key application feature being supported through the AWS platform. Further reference can be found here:
     + [Shadow MQTT Topics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-shadow-mqtt.html)
7. For PIC-IoT development not provisioned for the AWS platform; refer to the below repo location:
     + **gitHub Provisioning Repo coming in future. Currently refer to:**
     + [AVR-IoT AWS Provisioning](https://www.microchip.com/wwwAppNotes/AppNotes.aspx?appnote=en611265)

## Understanding the Device Shadow in AWS 

  1. The AWS broker allows for the use of Shadow Topics. The Shadow Topics are used to retain a specific value within the Broker, so End-Device status updates can be managed.
     + Shadow Topics are used to restore the state of variables, or applications.
     + Shadow Topics retain expected values, and report if Published data reflects a difference in value.
     + When difference exist, status of the delta is reported to those subscribed to appropriate topic messages.
  
     ![ShadowTopic UserStory](images/AWS_ShadowUserStory.png)
	 
  2. Updates to the device shadow are published on $aws/things/{ThingName}/shadow/update topic. 
     When a message is sent to the board by changing the value of the **toggle** fiels in **Control Your Device** section:
	 + This message is published on the $aws/things/{ThingName}/shadow/update topic. 
	 + If the curent value of **toggle** in the device shadow is different from the **toggle** value present in the AWS Device Shadow, the AWS Shadow service reports this change to the device by publishing a message on $aws/things/{ThingName}/shadow/update/delta topic.
	 + The JSON structure of the message sent should appear as below
	   ```json
        {
          "state": {
            "desired": {
              "toggle": [value]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
		
   3. The meta data, and delta difference will be reported via the Serial Terminal upon a difference between desired/reported.
	
      ![Delta Metadata](images/DeltaToggle.png)
	 
   4. In response to this, the end device publishes a message to $aws/things/{ThingName}/shadow/update topic.
      + This message is published to **report** the update to the **toggle** attribute.
	  + The JSON structure of the message sent should appear as below
	   ```json
        {
          "state": {
            "reported": {
              "toggle": [value]
            }
          }
        }
        ```

     + Default behavior: No Button Pressed
     + Soft AP: SW0 is Held on startup (see description farther in document)
     + Default behavior Restore DEFAULT Credentials: SW0 & SW1 Held on startup. This state is reflected by **BLINKING GREEN LED** until a Wi-Fi connection is established. 
          + After a successful connection; last VALID CREDIENTIALS are maintained in the WINC for next power cycle connection. 

  1. Connect board to PC using USB-micro cable. 

     + The LEDs will **Cycle** upon startup: **BLUE-->GREEN-->YELLOW-->RED**, short delay, **BLUE-->GREEN-->YELLOW-->RED**.

  2. The **BLUE LED** will begin to blink, this indicates the board is attempting to join the local **ACCESS POINT**.

     ![Connecting_2](images/picawsLeverage.png)

  3. Update the Wi-Fi Credentials; upon connecting the blinking will stop, and the **LED** will become **STATIC**. Below are the easiest methods to update credentials.
     + The board will appear on the PC enumerated as a mass storage device under the name **CURIOSITY**. Credentials can be downloaded as the file **WIFI.CFG** using the **CLICK-ME.HTM** file stored on the **CURIOSITY** device.
     
     ![URL Hosted Credentials](images/wifiCredentialsWeb.png)

     + This will launch the URL: https://pic-iot.com/pic-iot/aws/{ThingName}. 
     + After entering credentials, the **.CFG** file is produced through the web browser. No information is shared through the internet. 
     + Drag and Drop, or Copy and Paste the **WIFI.CFG** file onto the **CURIOSITY** device to load new credentials onto the IoT demonstration board.
	 
     
     ![WiFi Config](images/wifiNotepad.png)     
     
     + Use a **Serial Terminal** to update the WiFi Credentials loaded onto the WINC module. Use the Command Line Interface (CLI) supported command ``wifi host_name,pass_code,auth_type`` | host_name/pass_code are entered strings, auth_type is int value: (0: open, 1: WEP, 2: WPA).

     ![Serial Credentials](images/serialWiFi.png)

  4. After becoming connected to the ACCESS POINT, the GREEN LED will begin to blink, this indicates the board is attempting to establish a TCP/IP and MQTT connection with the cloud providing service. The GREEN LED will stop blinking and become STATIC when the TCP and MQTT connection is established.
     + Using the in module TCP/IP stack pre-configured with provisioned credentials; the device establishes a **MQTT** connection with the IoT Broker provider (AWS).
     ![Status Display](images/awsConnection.png)

  5. After successfully establishing MQTT connection, the **YELLOW LED** will blink, indicating data exchanged between the End-Device (PIC-IoT), and BROKER (AWS). 

     ![Telemetry Data](images/PublishDataToAWS.png)

  6. Connect to the www.avr-iot.com/aws/{thingName}, or www.pic-iot.com/aws/{thingName}, device specific website to view publish/subscribe data. 
     + This page can be found via launching the **CLICK-ME.HTM** file on the **CURIOSITY** device.
     + There will be (2) scrolling graphs visible. (1) shows temperature sensor, (1) shows the light sensor value. 
     + Additional graphs can be produced altered through the published topic message.

     ![Telemetry Data](images/awsSensors.png)

  7. **Control Your Device** using the (3) rows beneath the '**Control Your Device**' section used to publish subscription data to end-devices through the broker. 
     + **Only the use of Toggle is supported natively**
     + **Expanding features would require custom written Firmware implementation**
     + These example rows demonstrate options for: Toggle (boolean), Text Field (String), Sliders (integer)

     ![Subscribe Data](images/Actuators.png)

  8. When connection is established with the Broker, the publish message topic will be printed to a serial terminal through the CDC-USB bridge.
     + 9600 is expected Baud Rate.
     + When a topic subscription is received, the payload is printed in JSON format to the terminal.
     + Topic subscription message are sent when the 'Send to device' push button on the webpage is pressed. 

     ![Serial Subscribe Message](images/DeviceStartUpConsole.png)

  9. When the 'Desired' state is updated in the 'Delta' Shadow Topic. 
     + Device which required updates to the 'Desired' state which differs from their last 'Reported' value will receieve a published message on the '.../delta' MQTT topic. 
     + Upon reception the device will report the updated 'Desired' value for the attribute with timestamp on the console.

+ 4 : All

### Soft Access Point (AP)
The PIC-IoT development board can be accessed through a Wi-Fi access point enabled by the Software-Enabled Access mode of the WINC1510. This can be another way to connect the board to a Wi-Fi network. To enter Soft AP mode, press and hold the SW0 push button before plugging in the board. When connecting to the module hosted access point, the user will need to enter the desired SSID and password credentials for the network. After the user enters the details, pressing the Connect button will reconfigure network credentials for the device.

![Soft AP Credentials](images/softApCredentials.png)

### AWS Multi Account Registration
This [feature](https://pages.awscloud.com/iot-core-early-registration.html) is in Beta phase. The user can leverage upon the [provisioning tool](https://www.microchip.com/mymicrochip/filehandler.aspx?ddocname=en1001525) to register existing PIC-IoT board
in a personal account. More information on using the provisioning tool can be found in README.txt and iotprovsion.md which are part of the tool.

By default the AWS endpoint URL is read from WINC's memory. Upon using the provisioning tool the Microchip
sandbox AWS endpoint URL present in WINC will be replaced by the personal account AWS endpoint URL. In those
boards which do not carry the AWS endpoint URL in WINC's memory the Microchip Sandbox AWS endpoint URL provided
in the macro ``AWS_MCHP_SANDBOX_URL`` will be used.

The firmware supports the use of custom AWS endpoint URL. This feature can be enabled/disabled through the macro 
``USE_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT_URL`` in "cloud_config.h". Enabling this feature will ensure the AWS endpoint defined by the 
macro ``CFG_MQTT_HOSTURL`` in "mqtt_config.h" is used instead of the one present in WINC's memory for establishing 
the connection with the cloud. To switch to the usage of default AWS endpoint present in WINC's memory, disable 
this custom AWS endpoint URL by setting the macro ``USE_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT_URL`` to '0'.

In either case of using the default or custom option,the AWS endpoint URL being used can be observed on the serial 
terminal right before the board's start up LED cycle. Make sure to have the ``ENABLE_DEBUG_IOT_APP_MSGS`` enabled
to get the IoT application layer specific logs printed out on the terminal,
