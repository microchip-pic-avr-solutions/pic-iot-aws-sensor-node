@brief
    This is the main callback function for the Wi-Fi driver and is responsible for processing
    any M2M_WIFI events that are received on the Wi-Fi interface.
    These events (notifications) are usually received in response to earlier Wi-Fi requests such
    as @ref m2m_wifi_request_scan, @ref m2m_wifi_connect_open, @ref m2m_wifi_connect_wep,
    @ref m2m_wifi_connect_psk, @ref m2m_wifi_connect_1x_mschap2, @ref m2m_wifi_connect_1x_tls,
    @ref m2m_wifi_get_connection_info, @ref m2m_wifi_req_curr_rssi, @ref m2m_wifi_get_system_time, etc.

    Most Wi-Fi APIs are implemented in an asynchronous mode and calling them generates information
    that is then passed back to the application via this callback. For instance, a set of detected
    networks to be passed back as a result to a call to @ref m2m_wifi_request_scan.

    Applications must ensure a callback function is registered with the Wi-Fi driver by
    calling @ref m2m_wifi_init.
@param[in]  u8MsgType
    Type of notification. Possible types are:
       - @ref M2M_WIFI_RESP_CON_STATE_CHANGED

       - @ref M2M_WIFI_RESP_WIFI_RX_PACKET (If monitoring mode is active)

@param[in]  pvMsg
    A pointer to a buffer containing the notification parameters (if any).
    It should be cast to the correct data type corresponding to the notification type.

@brief
    Ethernet (Bypass mode) notification callback function receiving Bypass mode events as
    defined in the Wi-Fi responses enumeration @ref tenuM2mStaCmd.

    If bypass mode is enabled, applications must ensure this callback function is registered
    with the Wi-Fi driver by calling @ref m2m_wifi_init.

@param[in]  u8MsgType
    Type of notification. Possible types are:
        - @ref M2M_WIFI_RESP_ETHERNET_RX_PACKET

@param[in]  pvMsg
    A pointer to a buffer containing the notification parameters (if any).
    It should be cast to the correct data type corresponding to the notification type.

    For example, it could be a pointer to the buffer holding the received frame in case
    a @ref M2M_WIFI_RESP_ETHERNET_RX_PACKET event is received.

@param[in]  pvControlBuf
    A pointer to control buffer describing the accompanied message.
    This must be cast to the data type @ref tstrM2mIpCtrlBuf in case of @ref M2M_WIFI_RESP_ETHERNET_RX_PACKET event.

@warning
    Make sure that the application defines ETH_MODE.

@brief
    Synchronous API to initialize the WINC driver.

@details
    This function initializes the WINC driver by registering the callback function for the M2M_WIFI layer
    (also the callback function for bypass mode/monitoring mode if defined), initializing the host
    interface layer and the bus interfaces. Wi-Fi callback registering is essential to allow the
    handling of the events received, in response to the asynchronous Wi-Fi operations.

    The possible Wi-Fi events that are expected to be received through the callback
    function (provided by the application) to the M2M_WIFI layer are listed below:

     - @ref M2M_WIFI_RESP_CON_STATE_CHANGED
     - @ref M2M_WIFI_RESP_CONN_INFO
     - @ref M2M_WIFI_REQ_DHCP_CONF

     - @ref M2M_WIFI_RESP_ETHERNET_RX_PACKET (if bypass mode is enabled)
     - @ref M2M_WIFI_RESP_WIFI_RX_PACKET (if monitoring mode is enabled)

    Any application using the WINC driver must call this function at the start of its main function.

@param[in]  pWifiInitParam
    This is a pointer to a structure of type @ref tstrWifiInitParam which contains pointers to the
    application WIFI layer callback function, monitoring mode callback and @ref tstrEthInitParam
    structure (which contains initialization settings for bypass mode).

@return
    The function returns @ref M2M_SUCCESS for successful operations and a negative value otherwise.

@pre
    Prior to this function call, the application should initialize the ADAPTER using @ref winc_adapter_init.
    Also, the application must provide a callback function responsible for receiving all the
    Wi-Fi events that are received on the M2M_WIFI layer.

@warning
    Failure to successfully complete indicates that the driver could not be initialized and
    a fatal error will prevent the application from proceeding, proper error handling should be
    implemented by the application.

@brief
    Synchronous M2M event handler function.

@details
    This function is responsible for handling interrupts received from the WINC firmware.
    Applications should call this function periodically in-order to receive the events that are to
    be handled by the callback functions implemented by the application.

    Handle the various events received from the WINC.
    Whenever an event happens in the WINC (e.g. Connection, Disconnection, DHCP, etc),
    the WINC will interrupt the host to let it know that a new event has occurred. The host driver
    will attempt to handle these events whenever the application decides to do so by calling
    the m2m_wifi_handle_events function.
    It is mandatory to call this function periodically and independently of any other condition.
    It is ideal to include this function in the main and the most frequent loop of the
    host application.

@param[in]  pVArg
    Opaque argument, not used in current implementation. Application should use null.

@pre
    Prior to receiving events, the WINC driver should have been successfully initialized by calling the @ref m2m_wifi_init function.

    A length greater than or equal to @ref M2M_MAX_SSID_LEN will result in a negative error
    @ref M2M_ERR_FAIL.

@param[in]  u8SecType
    Wi-Fi security type security for the network (see @ref tenuM2mSecType). It can be one of the following types:
        -@ref M2M_WIFI_SEC_OPEN
        -@ref M2M_WIFI_SEC_WEP
        -@ref M2M_WIFI_SEC_WPA_PSK
        -@ref M2M_WIFI_SEC_802_1X
    A value outside these possible values will result in a negative return error @ref M2M_ERR_FAIL.

@param[in]  pvAuthInfo
    Authentication parameters required for completing the connection. Its type is based on the
    security type. If the authentication parameters are NULL or are greater than the maximum length
    of the authentication parameters length as defined by @ref M2M_MAX_PSK_LEN a negative error will
    return @ref M2M_ERR_FAIL indicating connection failure.

@param[in]  u16Ch
    Wi-Fi channel number as defined in @ref tenuM2mScanCh enumeration. Specification of a channel
    number greater than @ref M2M_WIFI_CH_14 returns a negative error @ref M2M_ERR_FAIL unless
    the value is @ref M2M_WIFI_CH_ALL. A channel number of @ref M2M_WIFI_CH_ALL indicates that the
    firmware should scan all channels to find the SSID specified in parameter pcSsid.

    Failure to find the connection match will return a negative error
    @ref M2M_DEFAULT_CONN_SCAN_MISMATCH.

@param[in]  u8NoSaveCred
    Option to store the access point SSID and password into the WINC flash memory or not.

@pre
    Prior to a successful connection request, the Wi-Fi driver must have been successfully initialized through the call of the @ref m2m_wifi_init function.

@warning
    If there is a '\0' character within the first u8SsidLen characters, then this function will assume
    that the input u8SsidLen was incorrect, set length to strlen(pcSsid) and continue.\n
    This function has been deprecated since v19.6.1 and will no longer be supported afterwards.
    The following should be used instead:
    @ref m2m_wifi_connect_open

    Additionally:
    - This function must be called in station mode only.
    - Successful completion of this function does not guarantee success of the WIFI connection, and

@brief
    Asynchronous API for control of Wi-Fi provisioning functionality.

@details
    This function allows the application to start the WINC in 'provisioning mode', a special mode
    that triggers the WINC to create a Wi-Fi access point, DHCP server, and HTTP server.

    The HTTP server presents a provisioning page to a connected client which lists the access points
    detected in the vicinity of the WINC, and allows one of these to be selected and any appropriate
    credentials to be entered. This allows a headless system to be provisioned (configured to
    connect with an access point).

    Provisioning status is returned in an event @ref M2M_WIFI_RESP_PROVISION_INFO.

@param[in]  pstrAPConfig
    AP configuration parameters as defined in @ref tstrM2MAPConfig configuration structure.
    If a NULL value is passed in, the call will result in a negative error @ref M2M_ERR_FAIL.

@param[in]  pcHttpServerDomainName
    Domain name of the HTTP Provision WEB server which others will use to load the provisioning Home page.
    The domain name can have one of the following 3 forms:
    - 1. "wincprov.com"
    - 2. "http://wincprov.com"
    - 3. "https://wincprov.com"

    Forms 1 and 2 are equivalent, they will both start a plain http server, while form 3
    will start a secure HTTP provisioning Session (HTTP over SSL connection).

@param[in]  bEnableHttpRedirect
    A flag to enable/disable the HTTP redirect feature. If Secure provisioning is enabled (i.e. the server
    domain name uses "https" prefix) this flag is ignored (no meaning for redirect in HTTPS).
    Possible values are:
        - Zero:     DO NOT use HTTP Redirect. In this case, the associated device could open the provisioning
                    page ONLY when the HTTP Provision URL of the WINC HTTP Server is correctly written on the browser.
        - Non-Zero: Use HTTP Redirect. In this case, all http traffic (http://URL) from the associated
                    device (Phone, PC, etc) will be redirected to the WINC HTTP Provisioning Home page.

@pre
    - A Wi-Fi notification callback of type @ref tpfAppWifiCb MUST be implemented and registered at startup.
    Registering the callback is done through passing it to the initialization @ref m2m_wifi_init function.

@brief
    Asynchronous Wi-Fi scan request on the given channel and the hidden scan list.

@details
    The scan status is delivered in the Wi-Fi event callback and then the application
    is to read the scan results sequentially.
    The number of  APs found (N) is returned in event @ref M2M_WIFI_RESP_SCAN_DONE with the number of found
    APs.
    The application could read the list of APs by calling the function @ref m2m_wifi_req_scan_result N times.

@param[in]  u8Ch
    RF Channel ID for SCAN operation. It should be set according to @ref tenuM2mScanCh.
    With a value of @ref M2M_WIFI_CH_ALL, means to scan all channels.

@param[in]  pu8Ssidlist
    u8SsidList is a buffer containing a list of hidden SSIDs to
    include during the scan. The first byte in the buffer, u8SsidList[0],
    is the number of SSIDs encoded in the string. The number of hidden SSIDs
    cannot exceed @ref MAX_HIDDEN_SITES. All SSIDs are concatenated in the following
    bytes and each SSID is prefixed with a one-byte header containing its length.
    The total number of bytes in u8SsidList buffer, including length byte, cannot
    exceed 133 bytes (MAX_HIDDEN_SITES SSIDs x 32 bytes each, which is max SSID length).
    For instance, encoding the two hidden SSIDs "DEMO_AP" and "TEST"
    results in the following buffer content:

@code
    uint8_t u8SsidList[14];
    u8SsidList[0] = 2; // Number of SSIDs is 2
    u8SsidList[1] = 7; // Length of the string "DEMO_AP" without NULL termination
    memcpy(&u8SsidList[2], "DEMO_AP", 7);  // Bytes index 2-9 containing the string DEMO_AP
    u8SsidList[9] = 4; // Length of the string "TEST" without NULL termination
    memcpy(&u8SsidList[10], "TEST", 4);  // Bytes index 10-13 containing the string TEST
@endcode
