    Read a specified block of data from the SPI flash.

    Pointer to a data buffer to be filled with data.

@param[in]  u32Addr
    Address offset within the SPI flash to read the data from.

    Total size of data to be read (in bytes).

@note
    No firmware is required to be loaded on the WINC for the SPI flash to be accessed.

@warning
    The read must not exceed the last address of the flash.

@warning
    If the WINC device has running firmware it must be stopped before interacting with
    the SPI flash using @ref m2m_wifi_download_mode.

@param[in]  u32Offset
    Address offset within the SPI flash to write the data to.

@note

@brief          Erase a specified range of sectors within the SPI flash.

@param[in]  u32Offset
    Address offset within the SPI flash to erase from.

@param[in]  u32Sz
    Total size of data to be erased (in bytes).

@note
    No firmware is required to be loaded on the WINC for the SPI flash to be accessed.

@note
    The SPI flash is erased in whole sectors, therefore if @p u32Offset is not aligned
    with a sector boundary it will rounded down to the nearest sector start address.
    If the erase range ends before a sector boundary it will be rounded up to include
    a complete sector.

@warning
    The read must not exceed the last address of the flash.

@warning
    If the WINC device has running firmware it must be stopped before interacting with
    the SPI flash using @ref m2m_wifi_download_mode.
